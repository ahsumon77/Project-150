Title: Bird killing Game

Overview
The Bird Killer Game is a console-based adventure developed in C++, combining entertainment and programming 
practice. Players take on the role of a skilled bird hunter with the objective of eliminating various bird species while 
navigating through challenging levels.

Key Features;

1. Player-Controlled Shooter:
○ Utilize arrow keys for precise movement control.
○ Engage in the thrill of shooting birds using the spacebar.

2. Diverse Bird Species:
○ Encounter a variety of bird types, each with unique flight patterns and behaviors.
○ From slow-soaring eagles to erratic sparrows, each species presents a different challenge.

3. Score Tracking:
○ Accumulate points for each successful bird hit.
○ Experience the satisfaction of achieving a high score as you progress through the game.

4. Progressive Difficulty Levels:
○ Face increasing challenges with each level, featuring faster and more elusive birds.
○ Test your skills as you advance through the game's dynamically adjusting difficulty curve.

5. Console-Based Graphics:
○ Immerse yourself in the game's environment with simple yet effective console-based graphics.
○ Experience the excitement of the hunt within the constraints of a text-based interface.

Technical Details:

● Programming Language: C++
● Graphics Library: Console-based graphics for a minimalist and accessible visual experience.
● Classes: Player, Bird, GameEngine, ScoreManager - encapsulating different aspects of the game logic

Game Mechanics:

● Player Controls:
1. Navigate the game using arrow keys for movement precision.
2. Engage in the hunt with intuitive spacebar shooting controls.

● Bird Behaviors:
1. Encounter birds with randomized flight patterns, adding unpredictability to the gameplay.
2.Adapt to different species exhibiting varying speeds and evasive maneuvers.

● Scoring System:
1.Earn points for each successful hit.
2.Strive for accuracy and consecutive hits to achieve a higher score

DEVELOPING GOALS
